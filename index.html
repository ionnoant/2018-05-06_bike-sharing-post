<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post I explore anonymized bike-share trip data, posted on the City of Toronto’s Open Data website, and identify some key learnings surrounding trips made within Toronto’s bike-share system. Specifically, I develop a better understanding of how long an individual spends riding their bike, when that person is most likely going to rent a bike, and from where.</p>
<p>The data shows that for a majority of bike trips in 2016, over 90%, were shorter than 30 minutes and that, depending on the month, the median bike trip was somewhere between 9 to 12 minutes long; however, these results are heavily dependent on whether a rider had a membership with Bike Share Toronto. Participants with a membership rode their bike for 11 minutes, compared to non-members, who rode for 30 minutes, on average.</p>
<p>The most popular starting location in Toronto is Union Station; the least popular starting location is Danforth Avenue and Westlake Avenue, just near Main Street subway station. Individuals that start at a top-20 location typically spend less time on their bike than those that do not.</p>
<p>Over 11% of bike trips occurred between 11 pm and 1 am in 2016; a higher proportion of total bike trips occurred weekdays around 11 am and 8pm. This is a strange finding, especially given that in 2014 and 2015 a higher proportion of bike trips happened around 8 am and 5 pm.</p>
<p>Scroll down to look at all the visualizations that informed this analysis. The extra visualization illustrates all the bike trips coming out of Union Station for 2016. The size of the circle indicates which stations were the most population ending station from Union Station.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The raw data used to conduct this analysis can be located on the City of Toronto’s open data website and contains annonymized bike trip information for the last two quarters of 2016, which is broken down by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trip start day and time</li>
<li>Trip end day and time</li>
<li>Trip duration</li>
<li>Trip start station</li>
<li>Trip end station</li>
<li>User type</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on this dataset can be located <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/transportation/#343faeaa-c920-57d6-6a75-969181b6cbde">here</a>.</p>
<p>The R markdown file for this post is located on my <a href="https://github.com/ionnoant/2018-05-06_bike-sharing-post/tree/master">GitHub page</a>.</p>
<div id="issues" class="section level4">
<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>I would recommend that you take care with the Bikeshare Ridership (2016 Q4) file as the <code>trip_start_time</code> and <code>trip_stop_time</code> columns are not the same data-type row-by-row. I avoided the issue by only capturing the hour and minutes information with the two variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/transportation/#84045f23-7465-0892-8889-7b6f91049b29">Bike Share Toronto JSON feed</a>, that provides system information, contains bike station information, specifically bike station names, that differ from those in the Bikeshare Ridership datasets.</p>
<p>I’ve reached out to the Open Data team to confirm whether an adjustment can be made to the Bike Ridership datasets.</p>
<p>Update: Since I commented on the two issues above the Open Data team has posted new 2014-2015 information on Bike Share data, it seems that the first issue still remains but that the second issue is partially resolved. Some stations still appear to be missing.</p>
